# ERA_V2_S5
ERA V2 Assignment 5 was related to MNIST Dataset
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits

We created a basic model to train it

### In utils.py file you will find helper functions like defining train and test transformations, train and tes functions and training and test loss and accuracy

### In models.py file you will find architecture of CNN, in the output layer we have used softmax because the output labels are 10. So, when the output lables are more then 2 then its a multi-class problem so at that time we generally used softmax activation function

### We have then imported this utils and models files in our S5 ipython notebook to run our whole code
